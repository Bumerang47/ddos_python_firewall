### DDOS Python Firewall

A script to protect against DDOS attacks of the following type:
- TCP-ACK Flood
- TCP-SYN Flood
- TCP-RST Flood
- KIL-TCP Flood

Uses:
- scapy
- iptables
- tcpdump

Designed for use with python 3 for Linux.

He came to me somehow from the [depths of the Internet](https://hastebin.com/ruxacodino.py), after which there was a need to refine it. It is unlikely that it will be able to compete with more serious solutions to protect against DDOS, but nevertheless, it does its job.
